  bio: Kofi's artistic practice is an observation of the world around us, that he then puts into artworks for others to relate to or disagree with. Through Videography, Poetry and Creative Coding, he tries to highlight the realms of the human performance and the human mind in different scenarios. These situations can be described as social, internal, or even biological, which we face in our everyday lives. Adding music and visuals often helps to perceive one's own feelings, and to highlight the different subtleties that make us human. With a dose of technology, there is an endless range of progress in the human creative endeavours.
