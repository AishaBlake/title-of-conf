        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p>This Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines about what kinds of behavior will not be tolerated within spaces related to &lt;title of conf&gt;. We have a Code of Conduct because it is necessary and because it is part of our effort to create a safe and harassment-free conference experience. Those found violating this Code of Conduct may be warned or potentially asked to leave the event.</p>

        <h2>Who and what is bound by this Code of Conduct?</h2>
        <p>Everyone involved with &lt;title of conf&gt; is expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct. This includes, but isn’t limited to, attendees, volunteers, vendors, and guests. The Code of Conduct applies to both online and in-person communication, and includes, for example, things like slides, emails, online forums, booths, stickers, clothing, social media, and recorded talks. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the &lt;title of conf&gt; organizing committee.</p>

        <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
        <p>No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others.</p>
        <p>Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.</p>

        <h2>Alcohol/No-Alcohol Policy</h2>
        <p>During the conference day, we expect all to comply with our no alcohol policy. There will be an afterparty where alcohol will be available for purchase. Even in spaces where alcohol is permitted, drinking alcohol is not an integral part of the &lt;title of conf&gt; culture. Non-alcoholic drinks will be provided and encouraged. Over-consumption of alcohol/drunkenness is highly discouraged.</p>
        <p>Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.</p>

        <h2>What is unacceptable behavior?</h2>
        <p>Those involved with &lt;title of conf&gt; are expected to comply with both the letter and the spirit of this Code of Conduct, and are expected to contribute to the creation and maintenance of a harassment-free space.</p>

        <p>
            Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
              <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, technology, level of experience, career, career stage, and employment.</li>
              <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.</li>
              <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
              <li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
              <li>Violence or threats of violence.</li>
              <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
              <li>Stalking or following.</li>
              <li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
              <li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
              <li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
              <li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
              <li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
              <li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
              <li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Danger is not the same as discomfort. &lt;title of conf&gt; prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. &lt;title of conf&gt; reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
              <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”</li>
              <li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
              <li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct?</h2>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed, or if you notice that someone else is being harassed, or if you have any other concerns, please contact the &lt;title of conf&gt; organizers. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. If a participant asks you to cease a harassing behavior, do so immediately and respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, &lt;title of conf&gt; organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including permanent expulsion from all &lt;title of conf&gt; spaces without a refund and identification of the participant as a harasser to other &lt;title of conf&gt; members or the general public.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I report violations?</h2>
        <p>
          &lt;title of conf&gt; organizers are available via email at [report@titleofconf.org](mailto:report@titleofconf.org). During the conference, we will be wearing organizer t-shirts, which we'll call attention to during our opening remarks and in pre-conference communications. We will respond as quickly as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you report a violation of the Code of Conduct, we pledge to ensure your privacy during the report, we pledge to keep both the reporters’ and the victims’ information confidential (unless you explicitly agree otherwise). We pledge, if appropriate, to help you escalate the report to the applicable authorities, such as venue management, law enforcement, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of &lt;title of conf&gt; participants the general public. Additionally, in order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
        </p>

        <h2>What sources did you use for this Code of Conduct?</h2>
        <p>
          For much of this document, we remixed a Code of Conduct one of the organizers made for a previous conference. We drew heavily from GeekFeminism’s <a href="https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Code of Conduct for conferences</a>. We also drew inspiration from <a href="https://www.afrotechfest.co.uk/coc/">Afrotech Fest 2019</a>, <a href="https://codeandsupply.co/policies/conduct">Code &amp; Supply</a>, and <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Conference Code of Conduct.</a>
